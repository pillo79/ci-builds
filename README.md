# ci-builds

Central store for CI-generated JSON snippets and their metadata, with automated package index generation and publishing via GitHub Pages.

## How it works

1. Satellite repos pack their JSON snippets in an artifact and include this repo as a composite action at the end of their CI run
2. The action passes the JSON snippets and the OIDC-certified repo/branch to `store_snippets.yml` via `workflow_dispatch` on this repo
3. JSON snippets are committed to `snippets/{owner}/{repo}/{branch}/{version}/` in this repo
4. The `generate-index.yml` workflow triggers automatically, builds and publishes to GitHub Pages

## Repository layout

```
snippets/
  {owner}/
    {repo}/
      {branch}/
        tagged-versions               ← list of released version_shorts (one per line)
        {version_short}/              ← e.g. 1.2.3
          platforms/
            {version}-<snippet>.json  ← e.g. 1.2.3-rc1-build-info.json
            ...
          tools/
            <snippet>.json
            ...
          metadata/
            {version}-<file>.json
            ...
action.yml                           ← composite action used by satellites
.github/workflows/
  store-snippets.yml  ← reusable workflow called by the composite action
  generate-index.yml ← report generation + Pages deploy
```

## Versioning

Each CI run stores files under `snippets/{owner}/{repo}/{branch}/{version_short}/`.

**`version_short`** is always `maj.min.rev` (e.g. `1.2.3`), stripped from the full build version. The full version (including any pre-release suffix, e.g. `1.2.3-rc1`) appears in filenames:

- **`platforms/` and `metadata/`** files get a `{version}-` prefix (e.g. `1.2.3-rc1-build-info.json`). Multiple pre-release and release builds for the same `version_short` coexist in the same directory. When a new push arrives for the same prefix (e.g. a tag update), older files with that prefix are removed first to avoid duplicates.

- **`tools/`** files are stored without a version prefix and are **overwritten** on each push. They represent the current toolchain state for that branch, not a per-version snapshot.

### Release tracking

When a satellite triggers from a tag ref and the full version equals `version_short` (no pre-release suffix), the version is appended to `tagged-versions`:

```
snippets/{owner}/{repo}/{branch}/tagged-versions
```

This one-line-per-version file is read by `generate-index.yml` to drive the tool selection logic below.

### Tool selection

Tools accumulate across version directories, but the generated index only includes a subset to avoid duplicating tools already present in the public `package_index.json`:

| Run type | Condition | Tools included |
|---|---|---|
| **Pre-release** | highest version dir > last tagged release | tools added **after** the last tagged release |
| **Release** | highest version dir == last tagged release | tools added **since the previous** tagged release |

The reasoning: by the time a release tag is cut, the public index has not yet been updated — so tools from the new release must be included. But tools from earlier releases are already in the public index and should not be duplicated.

## Setup

### 1. Enable GitHub Pages

In **ci-builds → Settings → Pages**, set source to **GitHub Actions**.

### 2. Create a fine-grained PAT for each satellite repo

In **GitHub → Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens → Fine-grained tokens**:

- **Repository access**: `arduino/core-ci-builds` only
- **Permissions**: `Actions: write` — nothing else

This token can only trigger workflows on ci-builds. It **cannot push code**, read secrets, or access any other repo.

> No credential is stored in ci-builds itself. The commit is made using ci-builds's built-in `GITHUB_TOKEN`, which is auto-generated per run and never leaves the workflow.

### 3. Add the secret to each satellite repo

In each satellite repo → **Settings → Secrets → Actions**, add:

| Name | Value |
|---|---|
| `CI_BUILDS_ACTIONS_TOKEN` | the fine-grained PAT from step 2 |

### 4. Call the workflow from satellite CIs

The satellite job needs `id-token: write` permission to be able to acquire the OIDC token.

Upload the snippet files as a GitHub Actions artifact. The artifact must contain JSON files laid out under `platforms/`, `tools/`, and/or `metadata/`:

```
platforms/
  build-info.json
tools/
  gcc.json
metadata/
  ci.json
```

Then call this repo as a composite action. Pass the artifact name and the PAT for triggering the dispatch:

```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    permissions:
      id-token: write   # required — inherited by the composite action
    steps:
      # ... your build steps that produce JSON files ...

      - name: Upload snippets artifact
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: ci-builds-snippets
          path: snippets/   # directory containing platforms/, tools/, metadata/

      - uses: arduino/core-ci-builds@main
        with:
          token: ${{ secrets.CI_BUILDS_ACTIONS_TOKEN }}
          version: ${{ env.VERSION }}
          artifact: ci-builds-snippets
          # base-branch is required only when triggering from a tag ref:
          # base-branch: ${{ github.ref_name }}
```

The `store-snippets.yml` workflow downloads the artifact, which is expected to contain JSON files under `platforms/`, `tools/`, and/or `metadata/`.

All entries are stored under `{branch}/{version_short}/`, with a `{version}-` prefix added to `platforms/` and `metadata/` filenames. `tools/` filenames are stored as-is because they are only stored on full tags and are not strictly related to the core version.

The calling satellite's repository and branch are **not passed as inputs**. They are encoded in the OIDC token (a JWT signed by GitHub's own key) that is generated in the caller's context and extracted inside ci-builds. If the token is missing, expired, or was issued for a different audience, the workflow fails before any data is written.

### Why `workflow_dispatch` instead of a reusable workflow?

With `workflow_call`, the workflow runs on the **satellite's runner** — so any write credential must live in the satellite's secrets.

With `workflow_dispatch`, the workflow runs **inside ci-builds** — ci-builds uses its own auto-generated `GITHUB_TOKEN` to commit. The satellite credential is downgraded to `Actions: write` only:

| | `workflow_call` + App key | `workflow_dispatch` + Actions token + OIDC |
|---|---|---|
| Secret stored in satellite | App private key | Actions-only token |
| Stolen token can push code | ✅ yes (via app key) | ❌ no |
| Stolen token can read ci-builds secrets | ❌ | ❌ |
| ci-builds commit credential | App token (external) | `GITHUB_TOKEN` (built-in, ephemeral) |
| Source repo/branch verified | ❌ caller-provided | ✅ GitHub-signed OIDC token |
| Validation before commit | possible | ✅ enforced in ci-builds workflow |

## Customising the output

`generate-index.yml` clones the private package-index repo (via `PACKAGE_INDEX_DEPLOY_KEY` + `PACKAGE_INDEX_REPO` secrets) and for each `snippets/{owner}/{repo}/{branch}/` folder:

1. Derives the index name: strips `ArduinoCore-` from repo, concatenates owner, short repo, branch and `_ci`
   e.g. `arduino / ArduinoCore-zephyr / main` → `arduino_zephyr_main_ci`
2. Copies platform JSONs from `snippets/{owner}/{repo}/{branch}/*/platforms/` into `<indexname>/{owner}/platforms/`
3. Copies tool JSONs (subject to tool selection rules above) into `<indexname>/{owner}/tools/`
4. Copies additional tools from `<indexname>_staging/*/tools/` in the private repo (if present)
5. Runs `meld.py --ref-index prod.json pages/<indexname>.json <indexname>/`

Output: one `<indexname>.json` per repo/branch, published to GitHub Pages at:
```
https://{owner}.github.io/{repo}/<indexname>.json
```

### index.html

In addition to the JSON indexes, `generate-index.yml` generates `pages/index.html` — a browsable summary page published at `https://{owner}.github.io/{repo}/`.

The page lists every CI index as a collapsible row:

| Column | Content |
|---|---|
| Name | `{owner}/{repo} @ {branch}` — links to the JSON index |
| Latest version | Latest platform version across all builds |
| Last modified | Timestamp of the most recently committed snippet file |

Each row expands to show sub-groups per platform and tool, each with all available versions and their individual timestamps. A search bar filters across all entries. The production `package_index.json` is shown as a reference row (labelled "official") when a search is active.

### Required secrets (in ci-builds)

| Name | Value |
|---|---|
| `PACKAGE_INDEX_DEPLOY_KEY` | SSH read-only key to the package index repo |
| `PACKAGE_INDEX_REPO` | Github package index repository to use |
